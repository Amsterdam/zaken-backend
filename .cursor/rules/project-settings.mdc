## Project structure

- The project uses Django, which lives in `app/`
- The project uses Poetry for dependency management (`app/pyproject.toml`)
- The project uses Docker with `docker-compose.local.yml` for spinning up services, so runnings tests or running queries to fetch data from the database would require spinning up the docker compose service: `docker compose -f docker-compose.local.yml run --rm zaak-gateway <command>` (e.g. `python manage.py test apps/workflows --verbosity=2`

## Coding standards

- Work as a senior developer, preferring simple and DRY solutions over complex refactors.
